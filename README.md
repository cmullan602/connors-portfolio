# Connors Portfolio 

## Description

- I built this project to create a portfolio where I could store and link all of my completed work. I can use this portfolio to display my work for potential job applications. 

- I was motivated for this project by flexbos and wanting to explore what I could do with it. I enjoyed being able to add photos that I've taken to my portfolio as a further expression of my work. 

- The project contains an index.html file that is linked to a reset.css style sheet as well as a style.css style shet and contains a folder with several images. 

- I struggled through this project in the beginning and had to go back through flexbox lessons. What helped me most was wireframeing my website so I could get a better idea of where my containers needed to be and how to get everything the way I wanted.
